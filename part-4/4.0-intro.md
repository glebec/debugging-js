# 4. Treatment

Finding the bug is most of the work. But fixing it can still be done well or poorly.

* STOP. Do not just blindly change values to see if it works. You can "fix" a bug by canceling it out with another bug, which is even worse than the first one. And you learn nothing.
  * By the same token, do not "patch" bad behavior with exceptional cases. You've solved nothing, and added technical debt to your app.
* Understand the code in its larger / deeper context.
* Figure out what *should* be the fix, based on your understanding.
* Implement by changing one thing at a time. Work incrementally, in small pieces.
* Confirm the fix with several different tests.
* Run your automated testing suite.
* Once you have apparently implemented the fixâ€¦ `git commit`!
* RESIST THE URGE to refactor immediately after the fix. COMMIT FIRST!
