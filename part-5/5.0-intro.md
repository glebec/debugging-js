## 5. Reinforcement

With the fault found and fixed, now is the time to follow through and make this bug hunt worthwhile.

* Perform some sanity checks on the new codebase. Think through the logic.
* *After* committing the fix, refactor the code if it is warranted.
* Add a new unit test to your suite guarding against incorrect behavior. Confirm your test works by breaking the code again (temporarily).
* Consider other locations where you may have made the same mistake. Investigate.
* Enjoy your healthy codebase!
