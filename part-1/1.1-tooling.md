# Assistive Tooling

Automated help is free and will save you many times. Not using it is basically selecting "hard" difficulty on the start screen of your career.

* Linters
  * Like a guardian angel
  * [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) is a modern, configurable, well-designed linter for JS
  * [eslint-config-fullstack](https://github.com/fullstackacademy/eslint-config-fullstack) is designed to aid students in error prevention and learning best practices
  * Integrate ESLint into your editor of choice
* Autoformatters
  * Reveal the true structure of your code, not what you *think* is the structure
  * Can format online at [JS Beautifier](http://jsbeautifier.org/)
  * Get an extension for your editor (e.g. [JSFormat](https://github.com/jdc0589/JsFormat))
* Git
  * Make *frequent*, *small* commits
  * Commit only related changes (did you know you can commit just some files / lines?)
  * Final (pushed) commits should contain only *working code* (to your knowledge)
  * Make commits before moving on (e.g. refactoring)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
  * Makes npm package installation *deterministic* (and also more performant). No more "but it works on my machine / but it worked last month‚Ä¶"
  * Learn [SEMVER](http://semver.org/) and what major.minor.patch means. Then realize that it guarantees nothing.
* [husky üê∂](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
  * Lets you register git hooks which can run your testing suite before a `commit` or `push` or similar
* Continuous Integration
  * Examples: [Codeship](https://codeship.com/), [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)
  * Can integrate with GitHub and automatically run test suite for branches / PRs
