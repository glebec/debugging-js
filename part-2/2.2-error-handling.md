# Error Handling

* It is considered by some to be a mistake in the JS language that you can `throw` any value. Stick to throwing only `Error` objects or objects which extend `Error`.
  * Errors automatically capture valuable stack trace information
  * Other developers may assume your code will pass in or throw `Error` instances, and their code will not work correctly otherwise
  * [Creating custom Error types](https://mzl.la/2jbVhJS)
* Always remember to *handle errors* in async code (callbacks, promises)
  * The alternative is the dreaded *silent error*!
  * In a Node-style errback: `function (err, data) { if (err) doSomethingWith(err); ... }`
  * At the end of a promise chain: `.catch(someErrorHandler)`
