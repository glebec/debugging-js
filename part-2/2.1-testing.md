# Automated Testing

It is difficult to overstate the tremendous value of automated testing in general. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is also a useful approach to coding with many benefits.

* Examples: [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), [Blue Tape](https://github.com/spion/blue-tape)
* Help structure your approach (TDD)
* Confirm code works as expected (TDD)
* Prevent *regressions* (working code breaking in the future)!
* Running the test suite is an easy, painless way to check all is well
* Integrates with other tools such as Husky and CI services (see Prevention)
