# 2. Detection

Discovering a bug usually occurs because of any of the following:

* Automated testing fails
* Impossible to compile / transpile / launch / load
* Program crashes or stops behaving as expected while developing
* Program crashes or stops behaving as expected for user

Woe is the developer who discovers a bug and has no idea when it was introduced. It could be *anywhere*. Immediate, obvious feedback makes it far easier to track downâ€¦ and means fewer irate customers.
