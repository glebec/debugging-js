# Post-Mortem Debugging

When your app crashes, all is not lost. If it gasped out a stack trace with its dying breath, you may have all you need to track down the problem.

* Read the error message, but for *clues*, not gospel
  * Error messages are sometimes just string labels a developer wrote. They may be misleading or badly worded, and may have nothing to do with the root cause of the error.
  * Think about what the error is saying, and how it might apply to your codeâ€¦ and might not
  * Google unfamiliar error messages if necessary
  * Read the *whole* message. For example, npm errors always append a boilerplate warning on the bottom. If you haven't scrolled up to read the *actual* error message, you are missing the important part.
* Read the stack trace!
  * Ignore the traces from library code. 99.9% of the time, the fault is yours, not the library.
  * Note your own functions in the trace
  * Go to the line number(s) and column(s) identified
  * If you are lucky, the error will be evident, or at least local
  * If you aren't lucky, the line & column will be irrelevant. Let it go.
