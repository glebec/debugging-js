# Psychology and Approach

* People see what they want to to see. Stop *reading* your code and start *dissecting* it.
  * Example: did you know there are two "to"s in in a row in the above line?
  * And two "in"s in the previous line?
* Stop assuming. "Be the machine." Take things piece by piece and *test assumptions*.
* Use your head. Don't just try random stuff, *think*. Form and test hypotheses.
* Check easy & fast stuff first, even if it's unlikely.
* Consult documentation and other resources.
* Get more eyes on the code. Different perspectives help.
* Use "rubber duck" (aka "confessional") debugging: explain your problem carefully, step-by-step, to someone else. In the process you will often realize your mistake.
* Assume the error is your fault! It almost always is.
  * But ok, check the GitHub issues if you're convinced it's the library
* Be suspicious of recently-changes & often-buggy sections of code
* Give yourself a break. Take a walk. Come back to the problem with fresh eyes.
