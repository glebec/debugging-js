# Nondeterminism

* Intermittent, semi-random errors are usually due to nondeterministic code. Be extra-careful with certain patterns.
  * Async anything
  * Random / seeded elements
  * Initialization
  * Race conditions
  * Complex state (bad syncing of data across app)
  * State based on external factors (API, etc.)
* Use mock objects / methods to force a predictable testing scenario.
