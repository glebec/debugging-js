# Interactive Debugging

Relying solely on tons of `console.log` statements is like sprinting through a crime scene snapping a couple photos, and then trying to deduce what happened back in the dark room. It's much better to walk around at your leisure, looking and thinking carefully as you go. Interactive debuggers let you control program execution and investigate every detail.

* Use the `debugger;` statement.
* Learn the [Chrome dev tools](http://bit.ly/2k498lH)
  * The debugger
    * Normal and conditional (right-click) break-points
    * Stepping over, into, and out of functions
    * scoped variables and watch expressions
    * call stack
  * [The extended Console API](http://bit.ly/2iEP7pv)
    * Filterable log levels: `log` === `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`
    * Organization: `group`, `groupEnd`
    * Data: `table`, `dir`
    * Testing: `assert`
* [Node has a debugger too](https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html)
  * Built-in debugging client
    * `node debug yourFile.js` starts an interactive debugging session
    * `node --debug yourFile.js` launches the process in debug mode so other programs can investigate. Unlikely you'll use this.
    * `node --inspect yourFile.js` is an experimental feature which lets you debug Node from Chrome!
* [VSC debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging) (uses Node debugger)
  * click the debug panel and create a `launch.json`
    * VSC is pretty good about configuring `launch.json` automatically for Node, but you will probably have to tweak the start file
