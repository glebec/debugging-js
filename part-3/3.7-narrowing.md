# Narrowing Down

* How far do we get?
  * Log or step through each nested level down
  * Confirm the right route is being hit
  * Break dense statements into many small statements
* Apply binary search (aka the "Wolf Fence" algorithm)
  * Comment out half the suspicious code
  * Problem unchanged? It's not in the commented section.
  * Comment out half the remaining suspicious code
  * Repeat until the problem is found logarithmically
* Use *temporal* binary search with [`git bisect`](http://bit.ly/2k4hGZN)
* Use `git diff` (or view diff on GitHub) for more insight
