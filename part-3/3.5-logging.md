# Proper Logging

* Spray 'n' pray (`console.log` everywhere) is better than nothing at all, but still among the most primitive forms of debugging.
* Do not commit `console` or `debugger` statements to code. Debug code is a temporary measure and pollutes the runtime standard output.
  * If you want persistent, namespaced debugging calls, [use the `debug` module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug). That is fine to commit.
* Annotate your `console.log`s with descriptive, searchable, visible strings.
  * `console.log('======== FOO:, foo)` >>> `console.log(foo)`
* Don't concatenate; use commas. `console.log('foo:', foo, 'bar', bar)` will pretty-print the `foo` and `bar` values (interactively in Chrome), which is better than seeing their stringified form.
