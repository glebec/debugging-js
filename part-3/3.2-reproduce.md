# Reproduce the Error

Before you can even think of identifying the cause of your problem, make sure you know what the problem even is.

* Can you reproduce the bug at will?
* Does the bug occur in other circumstances / situations?
* Can you describe the bug clearly to a stranger?
  * "The cart doesn't work" is meaningless. "When I click on this button, it adds two items instead of one" is useful.
