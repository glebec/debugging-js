# Sanity Checks

Sometimes the problem is "stupid", yet you can burn a lot of time chasing it down. Some easy things to check, which can make a big difference:

* is the server actually running?
* is the server _restarting_ (e.g. if you use `nodemon`)? Or have you restarted it?
* is this the right file?
  * are you _suuuure_? Really, try adding a `console.log` to the very top.
* is it saved?
* is your build process working?
